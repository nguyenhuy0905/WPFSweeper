# WPFSweeper
New MineSweeper attempt of mine.
Only run on Windows due to its fraemwork.
Compared to oldSweeper, some clean-ups and organization is added, 
also some funny algorithms also.

### The funny algorithms (to be) used
- Depth first search to open an area after the player clicks on the board for the first time.
- Depth first search to detect an area surrounded with mines, and then remove some mines from there.
