# WPFSweeper
New MineSweeper attempt of mine.
Only run on Windows due to its framework.
Compared to my oldSweeper, this one is a lot cleaner, kind of better documented, and has some more features.
also some funny algorithms also.

### The funny algorithms (to be) used
* Breadth First Search to open an area after the player clicks on the board for the first time.
* Breadth First Search to detect an area surrounded with mines, and then remove some mines from there.
